## Built With

The website was built using:

-   [Laravel](http://laravel.com)
-   [React](https://react.dev)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com)

### Reactjs and Inertia

Inertia was chosen because of its simplicity when creating SPA and also serverside rendering, especially in the Laravel framework. because inertia does not have its own routing. so that the process of creating components and pages can be made more modular and custom. Coupled with reactjs with a lot of library support for creating a simple ui.
